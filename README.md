# Disease Outbreak Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting disease outbreaks using time-series analysis and machine learning techniques. We will analyze historical data to forecast future outbreaks and identify potential risk factors.

## Dataset
- **Source**: World Health Organization (WHO) or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
- **Content**: Contains historical data on disease outbreaks and related factors.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory to store dataset files.
- `preprocess.py`: Script to preprocess and clean the data.
- `model.py`: Script to build and train time-series models.
- `evaluate.py`: Script to evaluate model performance and make predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the dataset from WHO or CDC and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Run `preprocess.py` to clean and prepare the data.
5. Use `model.py` to train and evaluate the time-series models.
6. Run `evaluate.py` to make predictions and assess model accuracy.

## Future Work
- Explore advanced models like LSTM or Prophet for better predictions.
- Integrate real-time data sources for continuous monitoring and prediction.
